# Adrian Zavala - Big Project Testing 

## User Testing 
A user was asked to follow a complete a series of tasks using the application. 

## Questions
- Go to the brewery page
- Go to the favorites page 
- Go to the Reviews page
- Seearch for a Brewery named, "Goose Island"
- Search for a random cocktail
- Search for the cocktail name Whiskey Sour 

## Observations 
- The user was confused by the app. The first page is brewery look up page. 
- The user pressed enter when searching for a brewery and cocktail. The enter did not work 
to search because it does not have a listener. User then had to click search
- In the cocktail page, the user tried to press the chip filters as a search. The chips 
were meant to be filters. 
- User tried to add a review for a brewery , but the functionality did not work

## Changes
- I added a home page with a short description to avoid confusion with for the user.
- The cocktail page chips are now preset buttons. This will hopefully avoid some confusion
on the functionality
- Added 1-2 sentences on the top of the page describing how to use the page effectively.
